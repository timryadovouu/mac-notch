## Overview

**mac-notch** turns the empty space around the camera notch into a small control
center. Everything is a module you jump between from a horizontal icon rail; the
coral gear opens a proper Settings window. It's a single Swift Package
executable — pure SwiftUI + AppKit, **no third-party dependencies**.

- Runs as an **accessory app** (`LSUIElement`) — invisible in the Dock and menu bar.
- Sits over the physical notch and morphs like the iPhone Dynamic Island.
- Works on notchless Macs and external displays too (a synthetic top-center notch).

## Modules

| Module | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| ⏱ **Timer** | Pomodoro with focus presets (5 / 10 / 15 / 25 / 30 / 60 min), a long break every 4 sessions. Configurable break lengths and an optional completion sound. A live countdown shows to the right of the notch; each phase change slides a **Focus / Break** alert in from the left. |
| 📋 **Buffer** | A persistent clipboard. Everything you copy is saved as a **real file** under the buffer folder, in a per-day `YYYY-MM-DD` subfolder — text, images, and any copied files. Click an entry to copy it back, or **drag it straight out** to Finder / any app. Per-row copy & delete on hover; "Finder" opens the folder, "Clear day" wipes today. Deletions made directly in the folder show up automatically. |
| 🎵 **Media** | Now-playing + transport for **Spotify** (AppleScript) and **cmus** (`cmus-remote`). Play/pause reacts instantly. While something plays, a little **equalizer** pulses to the left of the notch; pause it and a coral ⏸ takes its place. |
| ✅ **Tasks** | A local to-do list: add, complete, delete, restore. **Undone tasks stay on top, completed ones sink to the bottom.** Copy a task's text, or move it to a trash that keeps deleted items for a while. |
| ⏳ **Screen Time** | Local, on-device usage tracking: it credits the frontmost app every second and shows ranked apps (with icons), total time and switch count. **Each day is kept as its own snapshot — browse past days with ◀ / ▶**, and toggle a 7-day bar chart. Resets at midnight; history retention is configurable. |

The **Tasks, Buffer and Screen Time** panels have a little home-indicator grabber
at the bottom — tap it to grow the panel vertically (and again to shrink).

## Beside the camera

When the panel is open, the black areas either side of the lens show live
**system metrics**: **CPU** on the left (coral bar + %), **RAM** on the right
(used / total GB). No tab, no clutter — just there while you're already looking.

## The collapsed strip

Even when closed, the brow stays useful:

- **Left** — a pulsing **equalizer** while music plays (a coral ⏸ when paused), or a
  brief coral flash on copy and a **Focus / Break** alert on a timer phase change.
- **Right** — the Pomodoro **countdown** while a timer runs, and a small pulsing
  **coral blob** whenever a Claude Code session is thinking (see below).

## Claude Code integration

Optional, off by default. Flip **Track Claude Code** in Settings and mac-notch
gives you two things:

- A pulsing **coral blob** on the right of the notch while any Claude Code
  session is actively working — it lights only between your prompt and Claude's
  stop, so it's a real "thinking now" indicator, not just "a session is open".
- When you hit a usage limit, a coral **"Claude will be ready at HH:MM"** line in
  the Timer tab — and **"Claude is ready!"** once the window frees up. The time is
  captured once and survives quitting Claude, since it's read back from disk.

**How it works.** Enabling the toggle merges a few [hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)
and a `statusLine` command into `~/.claude/settings.json` (your existing file is
backed up to `settings.json.bak` first, and your other settings are preserved):

- The **hooks** append session events to `~/.claude/mac-notch/events.jsonl`; that
  stream drives the blob.
- The **statusLine** is the only place Claude Code exposes when a usage window
  resets, so mac-notch installs *itself* as that command (a hidden
  `mac-notch statusline` subcommand). It captures the reset times and prints a
  compact footer: `Opus 4.8 · project · main · ctx 42% · 5h 63% · wk 21%`.

Because it becomes your statusLine, **your Claude Code footer changes to
mac-notch's** while tracking is on. Everything stays local — nothing is sent
anywhere.

## Settings

The coral **gear** toggles a standalone window:

- **General** — Launch at login, and Track Claude Code.
- **Modules** — enable/disable and reorder the tabs in the rail.
- **Timer** — short/long break lengths and the completion sound.
- **Screen Time** — how long to keep daily history (default 1 year).
- **Buffer** — folder location, auto-clear age, or clear-at-end-of-day.
- **Notch** — reset-to-default-tab delay and which tab is the default.

## Install & run

Requires macOS 13+ and the Xcode command-line tools.

Grab a build from [Releases](https://github.com/timryadovouu/mac-notch/releases),
or build it yourself. For development:

```bash
swift run
```

Build a double-clickable app (generates the icon, packages `mac-notch.app`):

```bash
./build-app.sh
open mac-notch.app
```

> Unsigned build: the first launch may need **right-click → Open** to get past
> Gatekeeper.

Quit from the red **Quit** button in the expanded panel.

## Where data lives

Everything stays on your Mac:

- Clipboard buffer: `~/Library/Application Support/MacNotch/localBuffer/`
- Tasks, Screen Time, settings: `~/Library/Application Support/MacNotch/`
- Claude Code tracking (only if enabled): `~/.claude/mac-notch/`

## Permissions

- **Media → Spotify** uses AppleScript, so macOS will ask for **Automation**
  access the first time — approve it or the track/controls won't work. **cmus**
  needs `cmus-remote` on your `PATH`. Nothing else requires special permissions.
